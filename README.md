# Sign-Language-Recognition-System

This project aims to recognize sign language gestures using advanced machine learning techniques. It is primarily written in Jupyter Notebook and Python. The system utilizes deep learning models to detect and interpret sign language in real-time, providing an invaluable tool for communication with hearing-impaired individuals.

## Features

- Real-time sign language detection
- High accuracy with deep learning models
- User-friendly interface
- Extensive dataset for training and testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aayush1693/Sign-Language-Recognition-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Sign-Language-Recognition-System
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
